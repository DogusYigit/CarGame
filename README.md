# CarGame
## Getting Started
Welcome! This is the repository for my first Unity Game. The game progresses with the codes written on the car and coins. Car, ground and coin objects were produced with piskel and added to the project. The aim of the game is to reach the finish flag with the highest possible score by collecting the coins on the way. The game was made through a [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-ile-2d-3d-profesyonel-seviyede-oyun-gelistirin/)  on udemy.
